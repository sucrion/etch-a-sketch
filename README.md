# Etch a Sketch Project
This is an app that replicates the experience of using an etch-a-sketch, but digitally. The classic hovering to change colour & reset wipe are there, along with the new possibilities opened up by its digital space: a changeable grid and colour variation.

## How It's Made:

**Tech used:** HTML, CSS, JavaScript

This project focused on making use of JavaScript functionality to create an interactive app. The layout is straightforward; all the complexity is in the JS, which makes use of or manipulates almost every element on the page. 

## Optimizations

Though the project is inherently limited in scope, improvements are possible. Most optimizations would involve giving more options to the user, such as selecting the specific colours involved (for both base and hovered squares), changing the number of squares the user can interact with at once (e.g. 4 squares at a time), etc. 

Additionally, it might be a better user experience to hold down a mouse button to change the colour of a square, rather than move over it as it is now. This could also allow for erasing with a second mouse button, for example.

Another major optimization would involve making the page usable on mobile, since it is based on mouse activity for now.

## Lessons Learned:

The project notably served as an interesting way to practice improving interactivity of a page (different types of events, managing changes in CSS through JS, how to handle toggling certain things, etc).
